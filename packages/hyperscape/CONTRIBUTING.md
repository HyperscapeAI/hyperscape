## Code Conventions

Please follow these guidelines for component development:

- **Component Architecture**: Follow Hyperscape's component patterns
- **State Management**: Use appropriate state handling for components
- **Event Handling**: Follow Hyperscape's event system conventions
- **Performance**: Optimize component updates and interactions
- **Reusability**: Design components to be reusable across different worlds
- **Documentation**: Provide clear usage examples and props documentation

### Example Component

```javascript
/**
 * Interactive component for Hyperscape worlds
 * @param {Object} props - Component properties
 * @param {Vector3} props.position - Initial position
 * @param {Function} props.onInteract - Interaction callback
 */
export default function InteractiveComponent(props) {
  const { position, onInteract } = props
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Setup component
    return () => {
      // Cleanup
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <component
      position={position}
      onClick={onInteract}
    >
      {/* Component content */}
    </component>
  )
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

- Test component behavior in different world contexts
- Verify interactions with other components
- Test performance with multiple instances
- Validate proper cleanup on unmount

## Linting and Formatting

- **Linting**: We use ESLint for linting. Ensure your code passes all linting checks before submitting a pull request.
- **Formatting**: We use Prettier for code formatting. Run Prettier before committing to ensure consistent formatting.
