## Overview

The Hyperscape RPG is a persistent multiplayer RPG featuring:
- Real-time combat with melee and ranged weapons
- Skill-based progression system (9 skills)
- Resource gathering and crafting
- Banking and trading systems
- Mob spawning and AI entities
- Comprehensive UI with inventory, equipment, and banking interfaces
- AI agent compatibility through ElizaOS integration

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun 1.0+
- 4GB+ RAM (for SQLite database and 3D rendering)
- Modern browser with WebGL support

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperscape/hyperscape
cd hyperscape/packages/hyperscape

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Start the development server
bun run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:4444`

### First Time Setup

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4444`
2. Create a character - you'll spawn in a random starter town
3. Use WASD to move, click to interact with objects
4. Right-click to open context menus for advanced actions

## Game Systems

### Combat System

- **Melee Combat**: Equip weapons and click on enemies to attack
- **Ranged Combat**: Requires bow + arrows equipped
- **Auto-Attack**: Combat continues automatically when in range
- **Damage System**: Based on Attack/Strength levels and equipment

## Development

### Architecture

The RPG is built using Hyperscape's Entity Component System:

- **Systems**: Handle game logic (combat, inventory, etc.)
- **Entities**: Players, mobs, items, world objects
- **Components**: Data containers attached to entities
- **Actions**: Player-initiated activities (attack, gather, etc.)

### Key Systems

- **RPGPlayerSystem**: Player state management
- **RPGCombatSystem**: Battle mechanics and damage
- **RPGInventorySystem**: Item management
- **RPGXPSystem**: Skill progression
- **RPGMobSystem**: Monster AI and spawning
- **RPGBankingSystem**: Storage and transactions
- **RPGStoreSystem**: Shop functionality
- **RPGResourceSystem**: Gathering mechanics

## Testing

The Hyperscape RPG includes a comprehensive unified test suite that validates all game systems through real browser automation and visual verification.

### Unified Test Suite

Run all tests with a single command:

```bash
# Run all tests (headless mode)
bun run test

# Run with visible browser (for debugging)
bun run test:headed

# Run with detailed logging
bun run test:verbose
```

### Test Categories

Filter tests by category:

```bash
# Run only RPG-specific tests
bun run test:rpg

# Run only framework/engine tests
bun run test:framework

# Run only integration tests
bun run test:integration

# Run only gameplay scenario tests
bun run test:gameplay
```

### Legacy Test Commands

Individual test suites are still available:

```bash
# Legacy test commands (for specific debugging)
bun run test:legacy:rpg           # RPG comprehensive tests
bun run test:legacy:integration   # System integration tests
bun run test:legacy:hyperscape       # Framework validation tests
bun run test:legacy:gameplay      # Gameplay scenario tests
```

## AI Agent Integration

### ElizaOS Plugin

The RPG supports AI agents through the `plugin-hyperscape` ElizaOS plugin:

```bash
# Start ElizaOS with Hyperscape plugin
cd packages/plugin-hyperscape
elizaos start
```

### Agent Capabilities

AI agents can:
- Join the world as players
- Navigate using semantic directions
- Engage in combat with mobs
- Gather resources and manage inventory
- Use banking and store systems
- Interact with other players

### Agent Actions

Available actions for AI agents:
- `attack` - Combat with enemies
- `gather` - Resource collection
- `go_to` - Movement and navigation
- `interact` - Object/NPC interaction
- `equip/unequip` - Equipment management
- `drop/pickup` - Item handling
- `bank/store` - Economic transactions

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./world/db.sqlite
WORLD_PATH=./world

# Optional
PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL=https://your-cdn.com/assets/
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your-livekit-key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your-livekit-secret
```

### Database Setup

The RPG uses SQLite for persistence:

```bash
# Initialize database
bun run db:init

# Reset world state (WARNING: Deletes all player data)
bun run db:reset
```

### Performance Optimization

- **Instance Limits**: Recommended 50-100 concurrent players
- **Memory Usage**: ~4GB RAM for full world with all systems
- **CPU Usage**: Scales with player count and active combat
- **Database**: SQLite handles thousands of players efficiently

## API Reference

### State Queries

Query game state via REST API:

```bash
# Get all available state queries
GET /api/state

# Get player stats
GET /api/state/player-stats?playerId=123

# Get world info
GET /api/state/world-info
```

### Action Execution

Execute actions via REST API:

```bash
# Get available actions for player
GET /api/actions/available?playerId=123

# Execute action
POST /api/actions/attack
{
  "targetId": "goblin-456",
  "playerId": "123"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server won't start**
- Check Node.js version (18+ required)
- Verify SQLite database permissions
- Ensure port 4444 is available

**Client connection fails**
- Verify WebSocket connection (check browser dev tools)
- Confirm server is running on correct port
- Check firewall settings

**Visual rendering issues**
- Ensure WebGL is supported in browser
- Check for GPU driver updates
- Try different browser if issues persist

**Performance problems**
- Reduce concurrent player count
- Monitor memory usage (4GB+ recommended)
- Check database size and optimize if needed

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```bash
# Start with debug output
DEBUG=hyperscape:* bun run dev

# Enable RPG system debugging
DEBUG=rpg:* bun run dev
```

### Test Validation

Verify installation with integration tests:

```bash
# Quick health check
bun run test:health

# Full system validation
bun run test:rpg:integration
```
