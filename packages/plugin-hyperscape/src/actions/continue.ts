const continueTemplate = `# Task: Generate a follow-up message for {{agentName}}.
{{providers}}

# Instructions: Write a natural follow-up response that continues the conversation.
"thought" should describe what the agent is thinking about for the follow-up.
"message" should be the follow-up message that keeps the conversation flowing.

The follow-up should:
- Build on previous context
- Ask clarifying questions or provide additional information
- Keep the user engaged
- Feel natural and conversational

Response format should be formatted in a valid JSON block like this:
\`\`\`json
{
    "thought": "<string>",
    "message": "<string>"
}
\`\`\`

Your response should include the valid JSON block and nothing else.`
