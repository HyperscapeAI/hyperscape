   - **Production Branch**: `main` (default)
   - **Staging Branch**: Create new branch for testing
   - Each branch has its own connection string

#### Step 2.3: Configure Environment Variables

**Local Development (.env):**
```bash
# packages/server/.env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
USE_LOCAL_POSTGRES=false
```

**GitHub Secrets:**
```bash
# Production database
NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require

# Staging database (optional)
NEON_STAGING_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host-staging.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

**Cloudflare Workers:**
```bash
cd packages/server

# Production
wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
# Paste Neon connection string

# Or via dashboard:
# Workers & Pages → hyperscape-server → Settings → Variables
```

#### Step 2.4: Run Database Migrations

The server automatically runs migrations on startup, but you can run them manually:

```bash
cd packages/server

# Install Drizzle CLI globally (if needed)
npm install -g drizzle-kit

# Generate migrations from schema
bun run drizzle-kit generate

# Push schema directly to database
bun run drizzle-kit push

# Or use the built-in migration on server start
bun run start
```

#### Step 2.5: Verify Database Connection

```bash
# Test connection
cd packages/server
bun run build
bun run start

# You should see:
# [DB] Initializing PostgreSQL with Drizzle...
# [DB] Connected to PostgreSQL
# [DB] Running migrations...
# [DB] Migrations complete
```

#### Step 2.6: Neon Features to Enable

**Recommended Settings:**
1. **Connection Pooling**: Already included in pooled connection string
2. **Autoscaling**: Enable in Project Settings → Compute
3. **Backups**: Automatic, check Settings → Backups
4. **Monitoring**: Enable in Settings → Integrations
5. **IP Allowlist**: Not needed for Cloudflare Workers (they use connection pooler)
