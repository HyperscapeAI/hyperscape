- **`/update-rules`** - Memory-driven rule updates
  - Retrieves all stored memories
  - Updates existing rules in `.cursor/rules/`
  - Creates new rule files for discovered patterns
  - Living documentation system

- **Context Awareness Hook** (PreToolUse)
  - Memory retrieval from mem0.ai before edits
  - Complete monorepo structure mapping
  - Related file discovery (types, tests, imports)
  - Contextual guidance based on file type
  - Cross-package dependency awareness

- **Memory Integration** (mem0.ai)
  - Automatic conversation context storage
  - Smart memory retrieval on prompt submission
  - Session history persistence
  - User-specific memory isolation via git email
  - Memory search with contextual relevance

- **Rule Validation Hook** (PostToolUse)
  - TypeScript strong typing validation
  - Test file requirements checking (no mocks, Playwright required)
  - Code quality enforcement (no TODOs, complete code)
  - Integration with `.cursor/rules/` standards

### Features
- Full monorepo awareness across 9 packages
- Intelligent file relationship detection
- Automated standards enforcement
- Persistent context across sessions
- Non-blocking validation with immediate feedback

### Requirements

- `.claude-plugin/hooks/hooks.json` - Hook event mappings
- `.claude/context-hook.sh` - Context awareness script
- `.claude/mem0-hook.sh` - Memory integration script
- `.claude/validate-hook.sh` - Validation script
- `.claude/settings.json` - Project hook configuration

### Documentation
- Complete README with usage examples
- Troubleshooting guide

- [ ] Custom slash commands for common workflows
- [ ] Subagent for ECS system development
- [ ] Visual test result parsing and reporting

### Planned for 1.2.0
- [ ] AI-powered code review suggestions
- [ ] Automatic test generation from implementation
- [ ] Performance monitoring hooks
- [ ] Git workflow automation
- [ ] Package dependency graph visualization

### Planned for 2.0.0
- [ ] Multi-project memory sharing
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Custom rule engine with plugin API
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Advanced debugging tools

## Notes

This plugin is specifically designed for the Hyperscape multiplayer game engine monorepo, but the concepts can be adapted for other TypeScript/Node.js monorepo projects.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Non-blocking validation**: Warns but allows edits to proceed, trusting developers while providing guidance
2. **Memory-first approach**: Always retrieves context before operations to maintain awareness
3. **Monorepo-aware**: Deep understanding of package structure and dependencies
4. **Standards enforcement**: Automated validation against project-specific `.cursor/rules/`

### Known Limitations

- Memory retrieval requires internet connection (mem0.ai API)
- Hook execution adds slight delay to operations
- Bash script compatibility limited to Unix-like systems
- Memory storage limited by mem0.ai API rate limits
